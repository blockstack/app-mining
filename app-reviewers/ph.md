#Product Hunt
Product Hunt is a reviewer of innovation. The general description is available on https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/mining_intro.html#product-hunt

The score is calculated with a 90% monthly decay to your Product Hunt total upvotes. This will make a single big launch count less over time. 
You can re-hunt your app every ~6ish months if your app has significant changes.

The metric takes into account your number of new credible upvotes since last month.
